# Scala Project: Regular expression matcher

## What is Regular expression 
A sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
Or
Expression used to specify a set of strings required for a particular purpose.

(a|b)* denotes 
{Îµ, "a", "b", "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb", "aaa", ...} 

## What is Parser
It is a
1. a function
2. that takes some input in form of a raw sequence (like a string of characters)
3. returns some meaningful data built from the raw input

## Parser combinatory in Scala
A Parser Combinator implements a grammar using a structure of parser objects. There are two aspects to the result of a parser:
success or failure
the result
These parsers are constructed from primitive parsers and composition operators, such as sequencing, alternation, optionality, repetition.
P1 ~ P2
P1 | P2
